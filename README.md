# Destin Byrd
I recently graduatued from California State University Long Beach
with a BS in Computer Science. Language experience includes Python, C++, and some Dart in the
context of flutter android studio development.

Most notable projects are the creation of a Windows-focused virus for pen-testing purposes in the python language.

Creation of an android application with flutter using the dart language that allowed for the use of multiple social media api's in
order to send compiled posts and photos to multiple social medias at once without having to draft a post in each one.
